Overview
========
This package contains some modules to read and process the result files from
Dymola_ and OpenModelica_ with Python_. A script is included that will help you 
to browse and export the contents of these files to other formats.

Both simulation systems save their results in regular mat-files, but use a
special variable structure to store the data efficiently. An easy way to
access the data is MATLAB_, but some people (like me) don't have it or don't 
want to use it.

If you want to use this package in your own python scripts you should read the
section `Python API`_.

The documentation on the provided script DyMatExport is in the section
DyMatExport_.

Author, Homepage and License
============================
DyMat is developed by Joerg Raedler (joerg@j-raedler.de). 

Homepage: http://www.j-raedler.de/projects/DyMat

Development hosting: https://github.com/jraedler/DyMat

The code is released under the terms of the `BSD License`_, which allows the 
free usage, distribution and enhancement of this code. Feel free to send your 
contributions.

Dependencies
============
1. Python_ 2.x
2. SciPy_
3. argparse_ for Python < 2.7

For MS Windows you may consider using the excellent distribution `python(x,y)`_,
which includes almost everything you will ever need for scientific computing
with python.

Installation
============
The installation process uses the distutils_ package which is included in
standard python distribution. In the base folder of this package call::

    $ python setup.py install

to install everything. Have a look at the distutils documentation for more 
options.

Background
==========
If you do simulations with Modelica usually a lot of variables (names) share the
same values because the different parts of the model are connected to each 
other. Dymola and OpenModelica will store those values only once in a mat-file 
and let different variable names point to the same data (possibly with a
negative sign). Because of this structure accessing the values of a variable is 
not straightforward (that's the reason fro writing this package!).

If you export all variables the amount of data may explode because the same 
values are written a lot of times. It's possible that a mat-file of 1 MB results
in a new file of several hundred MB. That's why there is no simple export-all 
option in DyMatExport.

    **You have been warned: only export the variables you really need!**

The variables are stored as time rows. The number of elements in a row may be 
different. If a variable doesnt change, only the initial and the last value are 
stored. Other variables may change with every time step. That's why different 
data blocks with a different shape are contained in the same file. Each block 
has its own abscissa (time values). For some export formats you must not mix 
variables from different blocks!

Future Plans
============
* Implement some plot functions with matplotlib, qwt or gnuplot.
* Implement additional options for the export backend (like delimiter for CSV).
* Split the loading of the header data and other data from the mat-file. This 
  will speedup some of the functions but needs scipy 0.10 to work.
* Improve the tree view which is just a simple hack.
* Fix all remaining bugs, do testing on different platforms

Export Formats
==============

CSV
---
This is a well-known exchange format for tabular data. Variables are saved in 
columns with a header. Multi-block data will simply be appended.

Gnuplot
-------
Is a special form of CSV with fields sparated by whitespace. A header is 
included to show the column numbers. You can plot those files directly::
    
   gnuplot> plot "myfile" using 1:4 # plots column 4 over column 1

MATLAB
------
Every variable is stored as a single 1D matrix. This results in a simplified 
form of the original file, but in a bigger file with less metadata.

netCDF
------
netCDF is a highly efficient binary format for structured multi-dimensional 
data. You may use this option to prepare files for the ncDataReader2_. This way 
you can use the results of simulations as (interpolated) input data for other 
simulations.

DyMatExport
===========
This script is mainly a command-line interface for the python functions in this 
package. Every option has a long (`--help`) and a short (`-h`) form. Use this 
option to get help on the other options.

Exploring a file
----------------
General info on blocks and variables::

    $ DyMatExport -i myfile.mat
    
List all variables in short form::

    $ DyMatExport -l myfile.mat

List all variables including block number and description::

    $ DyMatExport -d myfile.mat
    
Show a simple tree view of the variables::

    $ DyMatExport -t myfile.mat
    
Show other variables which share data with the variable `foo.bar`::

    $ DyMatExport -s foo.bar myfile.mat

Exporting variables
-------------------
You need to specify a list of variables, either on the command line or read 
from a file. Variable names on the command line are comma-separated like this::
    
    $ DyMatExport -e "foo.bar,baz,a.b.c" myfile.mat

This will export the variables `foo.bar`, `baz` and `a.b.c`. For more than just 
a couple of names you should consider using a file with names instead::

    $ DyMatExport -x vars.txt myfile.mat

You may use the output from -l or -d to produce such files and just delete lines 
you don't want::
    
    $ DyMatExport -d myfile.mat > vars.txt
    $ $EDITOR vars.txt   # delete unwanted variables
    $ DyMatExport -x vars.txt myfile.mat

The output format defaults to `CSV`, you may specify other formats like this::

    $ DyMatExport -f netCDF -x vars.txt myfile.mat

Get a list of supported formats::
    
    $ DyMatExport -m myfile.mat
    
The output file name defaults to the name of the mat-file with a format-specific 
suffix. You may specify an alternative name::

    $ DyMatExport -o mynewfile.nc -f netCDF -x vars.txt myfile.mat

This will write all variables named in the file `vars.txt` to a file 
`mynewfile.nc` in the netCDF format.
